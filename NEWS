v1.3
----
- minor fixes to configure to support newer versions of autoconf.

v1.2
----
- added support for servers using the X Keyboard Extension, querying
  the find the name of the keyboard geometry and the symbols it is
  using.  this is mostly useful under XFree86, but i guess might work
  elsewhere too (like IRIX? maybe even newer OSF/1?)
